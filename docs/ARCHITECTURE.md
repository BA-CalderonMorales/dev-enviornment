# Development Environment Architecture

## Overview
This project provides a flexible development environment with multiple distribution methods, designed to solve common development setup challenges.

## Distribution Methods
Each distribution method is designed to be:
- Independent and self-contained
- Easily testable
- Well-documented
- Fallback-capable

### DockerHub Distribution
Primary distribution method using standard Docker practices.

### BitTorrent Distribution
Experimental P2P distribution to bypass rate limits and improve availability.

## Distribution Method Requirements
New distribution methods must implement:
1. Download mechanism (pull/fetch/build)
2. Image verification (checksum/signature)
3. E2E test suite
4. Fallback behavior
5. Version tracking

## CI/CD Infrastructure
Our pipeline runs on GitHub Actions and requires ongoing maintenance:

### Runner Specifications
- We explicitly use `ubuntu-22.04` runners instead of `ubuntu-latest`
- This choice requires periodic review and updates
- Major Ubuntu version migrations (e.g., 22.04 → 24.04) should be:
  1. Tested in develop branch (beta releases)
  2. Verified with all distribution methods
  3. Rolled out to main branch (stable releases)

### Version Migration Process
1. Monitor GitHub Actions announcements for runner updates
2. Test new runner versions in develop branch
3. Update workflow files with new runner specifications
4. Verify all jobs execute successfully
5. Document any compatibility issues or required changes
6. Merge to main branch after successful testing

## Testing Strategy
Each distribution method includes:
- Unit tests for distribution scripts
- E2E tests for complete workflow
- Integration tests for fallback mechanism
- Performance benchmarks
