# Development Environment Architecture

## Overview
This project provides a flexible development environment with multiple distribution methods, designed to solve common development setup challenges.

```

## Distribution Methods
Each distribution method is designed to be:
- Independent and self-contained
- Easily testable
- Well-documented
- Fallback-capable

### DockerHub Distribution
Primary distribution method using standard Docker practices.

### BitTorrent Distribution
Experimental P2P distribution to bypass rate limits and improve availability.

## Distribution Method Requirements
New distribution methods must implement:
1. Download mechanism (pull/fetch/build)
2. Image verification (checksum/signature)
3. E2E test suite
4. Fallback behavior
5. Version tracking

## Testing Strategy
Each distribution method includes:
- Unit tests for distribution scripts
- E2E tests for complete workflow
- Integration tests for fallback mechanism
- Performance benchmarks

## Adding New Distributions
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines on implementing new distribution methods.
