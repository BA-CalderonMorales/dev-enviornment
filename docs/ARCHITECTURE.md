```

## Distribution Methods
Each distribution method is designed to be:
- Independent and self-contained
- Easily testable
- Well-documented
- Fallback-capable

### DockerHub Distribution
Primary distribution method using standard Docker practices.

### BitTorrent Distribution
Experimental P2P distribution to bypass rate limits and improve availability.

## Adding New Distributions
