# Troubleshooting Guide

## Quick Fixes for Common Issues

ðŸ’¡ Most issues can be solved by:
1. Open Docker Desktop
2. Wait 1-2 minutes for the whale icon to stop animating
3. Try your docker command again

## Windows-Specific Issues

### Git Bash: winpty Error
When running interactive containers in Git Bash, you might see terminal errors.

**Solution:**
Add `winpty` before your docker run commands:
```bash
winpty docker run -it cmoe640/dev-environment:latest
```

Or create an alias in your ~/.bashrc:
```bash
alias docker="winpty docker"
```

### Docker Desktop Connection Error
```bash
error: open //./pipe/dockerDesktopLinuxEngine: The system cannot find the file specified
```

**Solution:**
1. Check Docker Desktop is running (whale icon in system tray)
2. Wait 1-2 minutes for full initialization
3. Try command again

## Docker Issues by Category

### 1. Installation Issues

```
**Solution:**
1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. Ensure Docker service is running:
```bash
# Linux
sudo systemctl start docker

# macOS/Windows
# Start Docker Desktop
```

### 2. Permission Issues
#### Permission Issues
```bash

### 3. Connection Issues
#### "Cannot find the file specified" or Docker Connection Errors

Follow these steps in order:

1. Check if Docker Desktop is Running
   - Look for the whale icon in your system tray
   - If you don't see it, open Docker Desktop from your Start Menu

2. Wait for Docker to Start
   - Docker Desktop needs 1-2 minutes to fully initialize
   - Watch for the whale icon to stop animating
   - The icon should turn solid when ready

3. Verify Docker Works
   ```bash
   docker version
   ```
   If this works, proceed to pull the image again:
   ```bash
   docker pull cmoe640/dev-environment:latest
   ```

4. If Still Not Working
   - Right-click the whale icon
   - Select "Restart"
   - Wait 2 minutes
   - Try the docker pull command again

5. Last Resort
   - Quit Docker Desktop completely
   - Restart your computer
   - Start Docker Desktop
   - Wait 2 minutes before trying again
