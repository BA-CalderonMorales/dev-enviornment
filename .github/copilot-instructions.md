 *
 * # Antipatterns
 *
 * Most of those are antipatterns in the Python programming language, but some of
 * them might be more generic.
 *
 * ## Strict email validation
 *
 * It is almost impossible to strictly validate an email. Even if you were writing
 * or using a regex that follows
 * [RFC5322](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#section-3.4), you would have false
 * positives when trying to validate actual emails that don't follow the RFC.
 *
 * What's more, validating an email provides very weak guarantees. A stronger,
 * more meaningful validation would be to send an email and validate that the user
 * received it.
 *
 * To sum up, don't waste your time trying to validate an email if you don't need
 * to (or just check that there's a `@` in it). If you need to, send an email with
 * a token and validate that the user received it.
 *
 * ## Late returns
 *
 * Returning early reduces cognitive overhead, and improve readability by killing
 * indentation levels.
 *
 * Bad:
 *
 * ```python
 * def toast(bread):
 *     if bread.kind != 'brioche':
 *         if not bread.is_stale:
 *             toaster.toast(bread)
 * ```
 *
 * Good:
 *
 * ```python
 * def toast(bread):
 *     if bread.kind == 'brioche' or bread.is_stale:
 *         return
 *
 *     toaster.toast(bread)
 * ```
 *
 * ## Hacks comment
 *
 * Bad:
 *
 * ```python
 * # Gigantic hack (written by Louis de Funes) 04-01-2015
 * toaster.restart()
 * ```
 *
 * There's multiple things wrong with this comment:
 *
 * - Even if it is actually a hack, no need to say it in a comment. It lowers the
 *   perceived quality of a codebase and impacts developer motivation.
 * - Putting the author and the date is totally useless when using source control
 *   (`git blame`).
 * - This does not explain why it's temporary.
 * - It's impossible to easily grep for temporary fixes.
 * - [Louis de Funès](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_de_Fun%C3%A8s) would never
 *   write a hack.
 *
 * Good:
 *
 * ```python
 * # Need to restart toaster to prevent burning bread
 * # TODO: replace with proper fix
 * toaster.restart()
 * ```
 *
 * - This clearly explains the nature of the temporary fix.
 * - Using `TODO` is an ubiquitous pattern that allows easy grepping and plays
 *   nice with most text editors.
 * - The perceived quality of this temporary fix is much higher.
 *
 * ## Repeating arguments in function name
 *
 * Bad:
 *
 * ```python
 * def get_by_color(color):
 *     return Toasters.filter_by(color=color)
 * ```
 *
 * Putting the argument name in both the function name and in arguments is, in
 * most cases and for most interpreted languages, redundant.
 *
 * Good:
 *
 * ```python
 * def get(color=None):
 *     if color:
 *         return Toasters.filter_by(color=color)
 * ```
 *
 * ## Repeating class name in method name
 *
 * Bad:
 *
 * ```python
 * class Toasters(object):
 *     def get_toaster(self, toaster_id):
 *         pass
 * ```
 *
 * This is bad because it's unnecessarily redundant (`Toasters.get_toaster(1)`). According to the single responsibility principle, a class should focus on one area of responsibility. So the `Toasters` class should only focus on toasters object.
 *
 * Good:
 *
 * ```python
 * class Toasters(object):
 *     def get(self, toaster_id):
 *         pass
 * ```
 *
 * Which produces much more concise code:
 *
 * ```
 * toaster = Toasters.get(1)
 * ```
 *
 * ## Repeating function name in docstring
 *
 * Bad:
 *
 * ```python
 * def test_return_true_if_toast_is_valid():
 *     """Verify that we return true if toast is valid."""
 *     assert is_valid(Toast('brioche')) is true
 * ```
 *
 * Why is it bad?
 *
 * - The docstring and function name are not DRY.
 * - There's no actual explanation of what valid means.
 *
 * Good:
 *
 * ```python
 * def test_valid_toast():
 *     """Verify that 'brioche' are valid toasts."""
 *     assert is_valid(Toast('brioche')) is true
 * ```
 *
 * Or, another variation:
 *
 * ```python
 * def test_brioche_are_valid_toast():
 *     assert is_valid(Toast('brioche')) is true
 * ```
 *
 * ## Unreadable response construction
 *
 * TODO
 *
 * Bad:
 *
 * ```python
 * def get_data():
 *     returned = {}
 *     if stuff:
 *         returned['toaster'] = 'toaster'
 *     if other_stuff:
 *         if the_other_stuff:
 *             returned['toast'] = 'brioche'
 *     else:
 *         returned['toast'] = 'bread'
 *     return returned
 * ```
 *
 * Good:
 *
 * ```python
 * def get_data():
 *     returned = {
 *         'toaster': '',
 *         'toast': '',
 *     }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Undeterministic tests
 *
 * When testing function that don't behave deterministically, it can be tempting
 * to run them multiple time and average their results.
 *
 * Bad:
 *
 * ```python
 * def function():
 *     if random.random() > .4:
 *         return True
 *     else:
 *         return False
 *
 *
 * def test_function():
 *     number_of_true = 0
 *     for _ in xrange(1000):
 *         returned = function()
 *         if returned:
 *             number_of_true += 1
 *
 *     assert 30 < number_of_true < 50
 * ```
 *
 * There are multiple things that are wrong with this approach:
 *
 * - This is a flaky test. Theoretically, this test could still fail.
 * - This example is simple enough, but `function` might be doing some
 *   computationally expensive task, which would make this test severely
 *   inefficient.
 * - The test is quite difficult to understand.
 *
 * Good:
 *
 * ```python
 * @mock.patch('random.random')
 * def test_function(mock_random):
 *     mock_random.return_value = 0.7
 *     assert function() is True
 * ```
 *
 * This is a deterministic test that clearly tells what's going on.
 *
 * ## Unbalanced boilerplate
 *
 * One thing to strive for in libraries is have as little boilerplate as possible,
 * but not less.
 *
 * Not enough boilerplate: you'll spend hours trying to understand specific
 * behaviors that are too magical/implicit. You will need flexibility and you
 * won't be able to get it. Boilerplate is useful insofar as it increases
 * [transparency](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html).
 *
 * Too much boilerplate: users of your library will be stuck using outdated
 * patterns. Users will write library to generate the boilerplate required by your
 * library.
 *
 * I think Flask and SQLAlchemy do a very good job at keeping this under control.
 *
 * ## Inconsistent use of verbs in functions
 *
 * Bad:
 *
 * ```python
 * def get_toasters(color):
 *     """Get a bunch of toasters."""
 *     return filter(lambda toaster: toaster.color == color, TOASTERS)
 *
 *
 * def find_toaster(id_):
 *     """Return a single toaster."""
 *     toasters = filter(lambda toaster: toaster.id == id_, TOASTERS)
 *     assert len(toasters) == 1
 *     return toasters[1]
 *
 *
 * def find_toasts(color):
 *     """Find a bunch of toasts."""
 *     return filter(lambda toast: toast.color == color, TOASTS)
 * ```
 *
 * The use of verb is inconsistent in this example. `get` is used to return
 * a possibly empty list of toasters, and `find` is used to return a single
 * toaster (or raise an exception) in the second function or a possibly empty list
 * of toasts in the third function.
 *
 * This is based on personal taste but I have the following rule:
 *
 * - `get` prefixes function that return at most one object (they either return
 *   none or raise an exception depending on the cases)
 * - `find` prefixes function that return a possibly empty list (or iterable) of
 *   objects.
 *
 * Good:
 *
 * ```python
 * def find_toasters(color):
 *     """Find a bunch of toasters."""
 *     return filter(lambda toaster: toaster.color == color, TOASTERS)
 *
 *
 * def get_toaster(id_):
 *     """Return a single toaster."""
 *     toasters = filter(lambda toaster: toaster.id == id_, TOASTERS)
 *     assert len(toasters) == 1
 *     return toasters[1]
 *
 *
 * def find_toasts(color):
 *     """Find a bunch of toasts."""
 *     return filter(lambda toast: toast.color == color, TOASTS)
 * ```
 *
 * ## Opaque function arguments
 *
 * A few variants of what I consider code that is difficult to debug:
 *
 * ```python
 * def create(toaster_params):
 *     name = toaster_params['name']
 *     color = toaster_params.get('color', 'red')
 *
 *
 * class Toaster(object):
 *
 *     def __init__(self, params):
 *         self.name = params['name']
 *
 *
 * # Probably the worst of all
 * def create2(*args, **kwargs):
 *     name = kwargs['name']
 * ```
 *
 * Why is this bad?
 *
 * - It's really easy to make a mistake, especially in interpreted languages such
 *   as Python. For instance, if I call `create({'name': 'hello', 'ccolor': 'blue'})`, I won't get any error, but the color won't be the one I expect.
 * - It increases cognitive load, as I have to understand where the object is
 *   coming from to introspect its content.
 * - It makes the job of static analyzer harder or impossible.
 *
 * Granted, this pattern is sometimes required (for instance when the number of
 * params is too large, or when dealing with pure data).
 *
 * A better way is to be explicit:
 *
 * ```python
 * def create(name, color='red'):
 *     pass  # ...
 * ```
 *
 * ## Hiding formatting
 *
 * Bad:
 *
 * ```python
 * # main.py
 *
 * from utils import format_query
 *
 *
 * def get_user(user_id):
 *     url = get_url(user_id)
 *     return requests.get(url)
 *
 *
 * # utils.py
 *
 *
 * def get_url(user_id):
 *     return 'http://127.0.0.1/users/%s' % user_id
 * ```
 *
 * I consider this an antipattern because it hides the request formatting from the developer, making it more complex to see what `url` look like. In this extreme example, the formatting function is a one-liner which sounds a bit overkill for
 * a function.
 *
 * Good:
 *
 * ```python
 * def get_user(user_id):
 *     url = 'http://127.0.0.1/users/%s' % user_id
 *     return requests.get(url)
 * ```
 *
 * Even if you were duplicating the logic once or twice it might still be fine, because:
 *
 * - You're unlikely to re-use anywhere else outside this file.
 * - Putting this inline makes it easier for follow the flow. Code is written to be read primarily by computers.
 *
 * ## Returning nothing instead of raising NotFound exception
 *
 * Bad in certain cases:
 *
 * ```python
 * def get_toaster(toaster_id):
 *     try:
 *         return do_get_toaster(toaster_id)
 *     except NotFound:
 *         return None
 *
 *
 * def toast(toaster_id):
 *     toaster = get_toaster(toaster_id)
 *     ...
 *     toaster.toast("brioche")
 * ```
 *
 * It all depends on the caller, but in this cases I'd argue that it is bad practice to return nothing when the toaster identified by `toaster_id` can't be found, for two main reasons.
 *
 * **First reason**: when we provide an identifier, we expect it to return something. Once again, this depends on the caller (for instance, we could try to see if a user exists by checking an email for instance). In this simple example it's ok because the `toaster.toast()` will fail immediately, but what if we were never calling it and creating some other unrelated objects? We would be doing things that we should never be doing if the object did not exist:
 *
 * ```python
 * def toast(toaster_id, user):
 *     toaster = get_toaster(toaster_id)
 *     # We should never do this! The toaster might not even exists.
 *     send_welcome_email(user)
 *     bill_new_toaster(user)
 * ```
 *
 * **Second reason**: `toaster.toast` will fail anyway if `toaster` is none (in Python with `AttributeError: NoneType has no attribute toast`). In this abstract example it's ok because the two lines are next to each other, but the actual `toaster.toast()` call might happen further down the stack - and it will be very difficult for the developer to understand where the error is coming from.
 *
 * ```python
 * def toast(toaster_id, user):
 *     toaster = get_toaster(toaster_id)
 *     do_stuff_a(toaster)
 *
 *
 * def do_stuff_a(toaster):
 *     ...
 *     do_stuff_b(toaster)
 *     ...
 *
 *
 * def do_stuff_b(toaster):
 *     # Here is the actual call where toaster is called - but we should
 *     # have failed early if it's not there.
 *     toaster.toast()
 * ```
 *
 * What's the correct things to do?
 *
 * - If you expect the object to be there, make sure to raise if you don't find it.
 * - If you're using SQLAlchemy, use `one()` to force raising an exception if the object can't be found. Don't use `first` or `one_or_none()`.
 *
 * ## Having a library that contains all utils
 *
 * Bad:
 *
 * ```python
 * def get_current_date():
 *     ...
 *
 *
 * def create_csv(...):
 *     ...
 *
 *
 * def upload_to_sftp(...):
 *     ...
 * ```
 *
 * `util` or `tools` or `lib` modules that contain all sorts of utilities have a tendency to become bloated and unmaintainable. Prefer to have small, dedicated files.
 *
 * This will keep your imports logical (`lib.date_utils`, `lib.csv_utils`, `lib.sftp`), make it easier for the reader to identify all the utilities around a specific topic, and test files easy to keep organized.

 *
 * This

 * shows that there's fundamentally no difference in performance between
 * `char(n)`, `varchar(n)`, `varchar` and `text`. Here's why you should pick
 * `text`:
 *
 * - `char(n)`: takes more space than necessary when dealing with values shorter
 *   than n.
 * - `varchar(n)`: it's difficult to change the width.
 * - `varchar` is just like `text`.
 * - `text` does not have the width problem that `char(n)` and `varchar(n)` and
 *   has a cleaner name than `varchar`.

 *
 * # Error handling anti-patterns
 *
 * ## Hiding exceptions
 *
 * There are multiple variations of this anti-pattern:
 *
 * ```python
 * # Silence all exceptions
 * def toast(bread):
 *     try:
 *         toaster = Toaster()
 *         toaster.insert(bread)
 *         toaster.toast()
 *     except:
 *         pass
 *
 *
 * # Silence some exceptions
 * def toast(bread):
 *     try:
 *         toaster = Toaster()
 *         toaster.insert(bread)
 *         toaster.toast()
 *     except ValueError:
 *         pass
 * ```
 *
 * It depends on the context but in most cases this is a bad pattern:
 *
 * - **Debugging** those silent errors will be really difficult, because they won't show up in logs and exception reporting tool such as Sentry. Say you have an undefined variable in `Toaster.insert()`: it will raise `NameError`, which will be caught, and ignored, and you will never know about this developer error.
 * - **The user experience** will randomly degrade without anybody knowing about it, including the user.
 * - **Identifying** those errors will be impossible. Say `do_stuff` does an HTTP request to another service, and that service starts misbehaving. There won't be any exception, any metric that will let you identify it.
 *
 * An article even named this [the most diabolical Python antipattern](https://realpython.com/blog/python/the-most-diabolical-python-antipattern/).
 *
 * The following full example:
 *
 * ```python
 * from collections import namedtuple
 *
 * Bread = namedtuple('Bread', 'color')
 *
 * class ToastException(Exception):
 *     pass
 *
 * def toast(bread):
 *     try:
 *         put_in_toaster(bread)
 *     except:
 *         raise ToastException('Could not toast bread')
 *
 *
 * def put_in_toaster(bread):
 *     brad.color = 'light_brown'  # Note the typo
 *
 *
 * toast(Bread('yellow'))
 * ```
 *
 * Will raise this cryptic and impossible to debug error:
 *
 * ```
 * Traceback (most recent call last):
 *   File "python-examples/reraise_exceptions.py", line 19, in <module>
 *     toast(Bread('yellow'))
 *   File "python-examples/reraise_exceptions.py", line 12, in toast
 *     raise ToastException('Could not toast bread')
 * __main__.ToastException: Could not toast bread
 * ```
 *
 * Sometime it's tempting to think that graceful degradation is about silencing
 * exception. It's not.
 *
 * - Graceful degradation needs to happen at the **highest level** of the code, so that the user can get a very explicit error message (e.g. "we're having issues with X, please retry in a moment"). That requires knowing that there was an error, which you can't tell if you're silencing the exception.
 * - You need to know when graceful degradation happens. You also need to be
 *   alerted if it happens too often. This requires adding monitoring (using
 *   something like statsd) and logging (Python's `logger.exception` automatically
 *   adds the exception stacktrace to the log message for instance). Silencing an
 *   exception won't make the error go away: all things being equal, it's better
 *   for something to break hard, than for an error to be silenced.
 * - It is tempting to confound silencing the exception and fixing the exception. Say you're getting sporadic timeouts from a service. You might thing: let's ignore those timeouts and just do something else, like return an empty response. But this is very different from (1) actually finding the root cause for those timeouts (e.g. maybe a specific edge cases impacting certain objects) (2) doing proper graceful degradation (e.g. asking users to retry later because the request failed).
 *
 * In other words, ask yourself: would it be a problem if every single action was failing? If you're silencing the error, how would you know it's happening for every single action?
 *
 * Here's a number a better ways to do this:
 *
 * **Log and create metrics**
 *
 * ```python
 * import statsd
 *
 *
 * def toast(bread):
 *     # Note: no exception handling here.
 *     toaster = Toaster()
 *     toaster.insert(bread)
 *     toaster.toast()
 *
 *
 * def main():
 *     try:
 *         toast('brioche')
 *     except:
 *         logger.exception('Could not toast bread')
 *         statsd.count('toast.error', 1)
 * ```
 *
 * **Very important**: adding logging and metrics won't not sufficient if it's difficult to consume them. They won't help the developer who's debugging. There needs to be automatic alerting associated to those stats. The logs needs to be surfaced somewhere, ideally next to the higher exception (e.g. let's our `main` function above is used in a web interface - the web interface could say "additionally, the following logs were generated and display the log). For instance, Sentry can be configured to surface `logger.exception` errors the same way exception are surfaced. Otherwise the developer will still have to read the code to understand what's going on. Also - this won't work with sporadic errors. Those needs to be dealt with properly, and until then, it's better to let them go to your usual alerting tool.
 *
 * Note that knowing where to catch is very important too. If you're catching
 * inside the `toast` function, you might be hiding things a caller would need to
 * know. Since this function is not returning anything, how would you make the
 * difference between a success and a failure? You can't. That's why you want to
 * let it raise, and catch only in the caller, where you have the context to know
 * how you'll handle the exception.
 *
 * **Re-raise immediately**
 *
 * ```python
 * import statsd
 *
 *
 * def toast(bread):
 *     try:
 *         toaster = Toaster()
 *     except ValueError:
 *         # Note that even though we catch, we're still logging + creating
 *         # a metric
 *         logger.exception('Could not get toaster')
 *         statsd.count('toaster.instantiate.error', 1)
 *         return
 *
 *     toaster.insert(bread)
 *     toaster.toast()
 *
 *
 * def main():
 *     toast('brioche')
 * ```
 *
 * **Be very specific about the exception that are caught**
 *
 * ```python
 * import statsd
 *
 *
 * def toast(bread):
 *     try:
 *         toaster = Toaster()
 *     except ValueError:
 *         # Note that even though we catch, we're still logging + creating
 *         # a metric
 *         logger.exception('Could not get toaster')
 *         statsd.count('toaster.instantiate.error', 1)
 *         return
 *
 *     toaster.insert(bread)
 *     toaster.toast()
 *
 *
 * def main():
 *     toast('brioche')
 * ```
 *
 * ## Raising unrelated/unspecific exception
 *
 * Most languages have predefined exceptions, including Python. It is important to make sure that the right exception is raised from a semantic standpoint.
 *
 * Bad:
 *
 * ```python
 * def validate(toast):
 *     if isinstance(toast, Brioche):
 *         # RuntimeError is too broad
 *         raise RuntimeError('Invalid toast')
 *
 *
 * def validate(toast):
 *     if isinstance(toast, Brioche):
 *         # SystemError should only be used for internal interpreter errors
 *         raise SystemError('Invalid toast')
 * ```
 *
 * Good:
 *
 * ```python
 * def validate(toast):
 *     if isinstance(toast, Brioche):
 *         raise TypeError('Invalid toast')
 * ```
 *
 * `TypeError` is here perfectly meaningful, and clearly convey the context around the error.
 *
 * ## Unconstrained defensive programming
 *
 * While defensive programming can be a very good technique to make the code more resilient, it can seriously backfire when misused. This is a very similar anti-pattern to carelessly silencing exceptions (see about this anti-pattern in this document).
 *
 * One example is to handle an edge case as a generic case at a very low level. Consider the following example:
 *
 * ```python
 * def get_user_name(user_id):
 *     url = 'http://127.0.0.1/users/%s' % user_id
 *     response = requests.get(url)
 *     if response.status == 404:
 *         return 'unknown'
 *     return response.data
 * ```
 *
 * While this may look like a very good example of defensive programming (we're returning `unknown` when we can't find the user), this can have terrible repercussions, very similar to the one we have when doing an unrestricted bare `try... except`:
 *
 * - A new developer might not know about this magical convention, and assume that `get_user_name` is guaranteed to return a true user name.
 * - The external service that we're getting user name from might start failing, and returning 404. We would silently return 'unknown' as a user name for all users, which could have terrible repercussions.
 *
 * A much cleaner way is to raise an exception on 404, and let the caller decide how it wants to handle users that are not found.
 *
 * ## Unnecessarily catching and re-raising exceptions
 *
 * Bad:
 *
 * ```python
 * def toast(bread):
 *     try:
 *         put_in_toaster(bread)
 *     except InvalidBreadException:
 *         raise ToastException('Could not toast')
 * ```
 *
 * Side note: an unconditional exception catching is considered even worse (see [hiding exceptions](https://github.com/charlax/antipatterns/blob/master/code-antipatterns.md#hiding-exceptions)).
 *
 * This is a better pattern because we explicitly state what happened in the exception message:
 *
 * ```python
 * def toast(bread):
 *     try:
 *         put_in_toaster(bread)
 *     except InvalidBreadType as e:
 *         raise ToastException('Cannot toast this bread type')
 * ```
 *
 * If we need to do some cleanup or extra logging, it's better to just raise the original exception again. The developer will know exactly what happened.
 *
 * ```python
 * def toast(bread):
 *     try:
 *         put_in_toaster(bread)
 *     except:
 *         print 'Got exception while trying to toast'
 *         raise  # note the absence of specific exception
 * ```
 *
 * Here's what would happen:
 *
 * ```
 * Got exception while trying to toast
 * Traceback (most recent call last):
 *   File "reraise_exceptions_good.py", line 20, in <module>
 *     toast(Bread('yellow'))
 *   File "reraise_exceptions_good.py", line 10, in toast
 *     put_in_toaster(bread)
 *   File "reraise_exceptions_good.py", line 17, in put_in_toaster
 *     brad.color = 'light_brown'  # Note the typo
 * NameError: global name 'brad' is not defined
 * ```
 *
 * Another way to show how absurd the anti-pattern becomes at scale is through an example:
 *
 * ```python
 * def call_1():
 *     try:
 *         call_2()
 *     except Call2Exception:
 *         raise Call1Exception()
 *
 *
 * def call_2():
 *     try:
 *         call_3()
 *     except Call3Exception:
 *         raise Call2Exception()
 *
 *
 * def call_3():
 *     ...
 * ```
 *
 * Another problem with this pattern is that you can consider it quite useless to do all of this catch/re-raise, since you will still need to catch at the end. In other words:
 *
 * > Error handling, and recovery are best done at the outer layers of your code base. This is known as the end-to-end principle. The end-to-end principle argues that it is easier to handle failure at the far ends of a connection than anywhere in the middle. If you have any handling inside, you still have to do the final top level check. If every layer atop must handle errors, so why bother handling them on the inside?
 *
 * _[Write code that is easy to delete, not easy to extend](http://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to)_
 *
 * A better way:
 *
 * ```python
 * # This is the highest level function where we have enough
 * # context to know how to handle the exceptions
 * def call_1():
 *     try:
 *         call_2()
 *     except Call2Exception:
 *         # handle it...
 *         pass
 *     except Call3Exception:
 *         # handle it...
 *         pass
 *
 *
 * def call_2():
 *     # Do not handle anything here.
 *     call_3()
 *
 *
 * def call_3():
 *     ...
 * ```

 * In simple terms, Model-View-Controller-Services add a few more layers to the
 * MVC pattern. The main one is the service, which owns all the core business
 * logic and manipulate the repository layer.
 *
 * ## Creating entities for association tables
 *
 * You'll often need association tables, for instance to set up a many to many
 * relationships between users and their toasters. Let's assume that a toaster can
 * be owned by multiple users.
 *
 * It might be tempting to create a `UserToaster` entity for this relationship,
 * especially if this relationship has some complex attributes associated with
 * (for instance, since when the toaster is owned by the user).
 *
 * Let me pull a few quotes from the [Domain Driven
 * Design](http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215) by Eric Evans:
 *
 * > Design a portion of the software system to reflect the domain model in a very
 * > literal way, so that mapping is obvious.
 *
 * > Object-oriented programming is powerful because it is based on a modeling
 * > paradigm, and it provides implementations of the model constructs. As far as
 * > the programmer is concerned, objects really exist in memory, they have
 * > associations with other objects, they are organized into classes, and they
 * > provide behavior available by messaging.
 *
 * > Does an object represent something with continuity and identity— something
 * > that is tracked through different states or even across different
 * > implementations? Or is it an attribute that describes the state of something
 * > else? This is the basic distinction between an ENTITY and a VALUE OBJECT.
 * > Defining objects that clearly follow one pattern or the other makes the
 * > objects less ambiguous and lays out the path toward specific choices for
 * > robust design.

 *
 * Entities should model business processes, not persistence details
 * ([source](http://blog.sapiensworks.com/post/2013/05/13/7-Biggest-Pitfalls-When-Doing-Domain-Driven-Design.aspx/)).
 *
 * - In that case, `UserToaster` does not map to anything the business is using.
 *   Using plain English, somebody might ask about "what toasters does user
 *   A owns?" or "who owns toaster B and since when?" Nobody would ask "give me
 *   the UserToaster for user A".
 * - The association table can be considered an implementation detail that should
 *   not (in most cases) leak in the domain layer. All the code should be dealing
 *   with the simpler logic of "user having toasters", not UserToaster objects
 *   being an association between a user and a toaster. This makes the code more
 *   intuitive and natural.
 * - It will be easier to handle serializing a "user having toasters" than
 *   serializing UserToaster association.
 * - This will make it very easy to force the calling site to take care of some
 *   business logic. For instance, you might be able to get all `UserToaster`, and
 *   then filter on whether they were bought. You might be tempted to do that by
 *   going through the `UserToaster` object and filtering those that have
 *   `were_bought` to be True. At some point, you might be doing the same thing in
 *   multiple places, which will decrease maintainability. If you were hiding that
 *   logic in the repository, you wouldn't have that issue `find_bought_toasters`.
 *
 * So in that case, I would recommend doing the following:
 *
 * - Create a `User` and `Toaster` entity.
 * - Put the association properties on the entity that makes sense, for instance
 *   `owned_since` would be on `Toaster`, even though in the database it's stored
 *   on the association table.
 * - If filtering on association properties is required, put this logic in
 *   repositories. In plain English, you would for instance ask "give all the
 *   toasters user A owned in December?", you wouldn't ask "give be all the
 *   UserToaster for owned by user A in December".
 *
 * Note that Domain Driver Design recommends avoiding many-to-many relationships
 * altogether:
 *
 * > In real life, there are lots of many-to-many associations, and a great number
 * > are naturally bidirectional. The same tends to be true of early forms of
 * > a model as we brainstorm and explore the domain. But these general
 * > associations complicate implementation and maintenance. Furthermore, they
 * > communicate very little about the nature of the relationship.
 *
 * > There are at least three ways of making associations more tractable.
 *
 * > 1. Imposing a traversal direction
 * > 2. Adding a qualifier, effectively reducing multiplicity
 * > 3. Eliminating nonessential associations
 *
 * Evans, Eric (2003-08-22). Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the
 * Heart of Software (Kindle Locations 1642-1647). Pearson Education. Kindle
 * Edition.
 *
 * Imposing a traversal direction is probably the best solution. In our example,
 * it's not immediately evident which direction is the right one (a toaster being
 * owned by a user, or a user owning a toasters), because that depends on what
 * this application is doing. If we're working on an app that lets a connected
 * user see their toasters, then we would force the relationship to be
 * unidirectional user->toasters.

 *
 *     results = find(color='blue')
 *     assert len(results) == 2
 *     for r in results:
 *         assert r.color == 'blue'
 * ```
 *
 * This is inefficient because we're installing four fixtures, even though we
 * could probably get away with only one. In most cases this would achieve the
 * same thing at a much lower cost:
 *
 * ```python
 * def test_find():
 *     install_fixture('toaster_2')  # color is blue
 *     results = find(color='blue')
 *     # Note the implicit assertion that the list is not empty because we're
 *     # accessing its first item.
 *     assert results[0].color == 'blue'
 * ```
 *
 * The general rule here is that tests should require the minimum amount of code
 * to verify the behavior.
 *
 * One would also recommend to not do this kind of integration testing for queries
 * going to the database, but sometimes it's a good tradeoff.
 *
 * ## Assertions in loop
 *
 * Bad:
 *
 * ```python
 * def test_find():
 *     results = find(color='blue')
 *     for r in results:
 *         assert r.color == 'blue'
 * ```
 *
 * This is bad because in most languages, if the list is empty then the test will
 * pass, which is probably not what we want to test.
 *
 * Good:
 *
 * ```python
 * def test_find():
 *     results = find(color='blue')
 *     assert len(results) == 5
 *     for r in results:
 *         assert r.color == 'blue'
 * ```
 *
 * This is also a matter of tradeoff, but in most cases I'd try to make sure the
 * list contains only one item. If we're checking more than one item, that hints
 * at our test trying to do too many things.

 * Building lots of automated comprehensive end-to-end tests was tried multiple time, and almost never worked.
 *
 * - End to end tests try to do too many things, are highly indeterministic and as a result very flakey.
 * - Debugging end to end tests failure is painful and slow - this is usually where most of the time is wasted.
 * - Building and maintaining e2e tests is very costly.
 * - The time to run e2e tests is much much longer than unit tests.
 *
 * Focused testing (e.g. unit, component, etc) prior to roll out, and business monitoring with alerting are much more efficient.

 * find the best software design pattern to utilize (or mix) to best scale our applications:
 *
 * A software design pattern is an optimized, repeatable solution to a commonly occurring problem in software engineering. It is not a finished design, class or library that can be plugged into your code directly. Rather, it is a template for solving a problem that can be used in many different situations.
 *
 * Design patterns are not language specific either. Good design patterns are implementable in most programming languages, depending on the capabilities of the language of course. They also speed up the development process by providing tested and proven development paradigms.
 *
 * Effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation process. Reusing design patterns helps to prevent subtle issues that can cause major problems later on. It also improves code readability for programmers and architects familiar with the patterns. In addition, patterns allow developers to communicate using well-known, well understood names for software interactions.
 *
 * Correctly using a design pattern is very important. Implement it in the wrong way and it can create more problems than it solves.
 *
 * A building architect will also use proven principles to solve issues that arise while designing a building. For example by applying a certain brick-pattern to a wall or pavement he may solidify its structure. It's easier to communicate the name of that pattern to the contractor constructing the building, than to go over its design every time this pattern is required.
 *
 * This article sets the basis for understanding design patterns and presents an introduction to the world of software design patterns by giving a brief description of all 23 Gang of Four patterns.
 *
 * The Gang of Four
 * " width="500
 *
 * As Boromir points out correctly, it's uncommon to give an introduction to design patterns and not explain who the Gang of Four are.
 *
 * The Gang of Four are the authors of the book, "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software": Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides.
 *
 * When the book was published in 1994, it initiated the concept of design patterns in software development. This influential book describes various development techniques and pitfalls in addition to providing 23 object-oriented programming design patterns. The patterns described in this book are therefore often called 'Gang of Four' (or GoF) design patterns.
 *
 * Nowadays there are more design patterns than just the GoF patterns. However, these 23 patterns are still valid, are often used and understanding these will provide a solid basis to your general design pattern knowledge. Therefore, this article is scoped to giving a high-level description of these 23 patterns.
 *
 * Design pattern categories
 * The Gang of four design patterns are divided into 3 fundamental groups:
 *
 * Creational Patterns provide ways to instantiate single objects or groups of related objects.
 * Abstract Factory Creates an instance of several families of classes
 * Builder Separates object construction from its representation
 * Factory Method Creates an instance of several derived classes
 * Prototype A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
 * Singleton A class of which only a single instance can exist
 * Structural Patterns provide a manner to define relationships between classes or objects.
 * Adapter Match interfaces of different classes
 * Bridge Separates an object’s interface from its implementation
 * Composite A tree structure of simple and composite objects
 * Decorator Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
 * Facade A single class that represents an entire subsystem
 * Flyweight A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
 * Proxy An object representing another object
 * Behavioral Patterns define manners of communication between classes and objects.
 * Chain of Responsibility A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
 * Command Encapsulate a command request as an object
 * Interpreter A way to include language elements in a program
 * Iterator Sequentially access the elements of a collection
 * Mediator Defines simplified communication between classes
 * Memento Capture and restore an object's internal state
 * Observer A way of notifying change to a number of classes
 * State Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
 * Strategy Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
 * Template Method Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
 * Visitor Defines a new operation to a class without change
 * For each of these categories, the design patterns belonging to that category will be introduced in the next chapters.
 *
 *
 * Creational Patterns
 *
 * Creational design patterns are patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms. They try to create objects in a manner that is suitable to the situation. Basic forms of object creation may result in design problems or added complexity to the design. Creational design patterns solve this problem by controlling the object creation in a certain way and hiding the creation logic. 
 *
 *
 * [Abstract Factory]
 * The abstract factory pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme, without specifying their concrete classes
 *
 * A factory of factories, or "super factory" so to speak.
 *
 * The client code calls creational methods of a factory object instead of creating products directly with a constructor call (new operator). Since a factory corresponds to a single products variant, all its products will be compatible.
 *
 * Client code works with factories and products only through their abstract interfaces and it does not need to know which exact concrete objects it gets from each of these internal factories. This allows the same client code work with different products. You just create a new concrete factory class and pass it to client code.
 *
 *
 * [Builder]
 * Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations
 *
 * In other words, it defines an instance for creating an object but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Newly created objects are referred to through a common interface.
 *
 * The more complex an application is, the complexity of classes and objects used increases. Complex objects are made of parts produced by other objects that need special care when being built. An application might need a mechanism for building complex objects, that is independent from the ones that make up the object as a whole. This is the problem that can be solved by using the Builder design pattern.
 *
 *
 * [Factory Method]
 * Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses
 *
 * Creating an object often requires complex processes that are not appropriate to include within a composing object. Several problems can occur when the creating the object. The object's creation may:
 *
 * lead to duplication of code.
 * require information not accessible to the composing object.
 * provide an insufficient level of abstraction.
 * not be part of the composing object's concerns.
 * The factory method design pattern handles the above problems by defining a separate method for creating the objects, which subclasses can then override to specify the derived type of product that will be created. This design pattern relies on inheritance, since object creation is delegated to subclasses that implement the factory method to create objects.
 *
 * Factory method versus Abstract factory
 * The main difference between these two design patterns, is that the factory method is a single method whereas the abstract factory is an object. In the Factory Method design pattern, the client expects an implementation of an interface or abstract class, but doesn't know exactly what the concrete class the factory will return. With the Abstract Factory pattern there is an extra level of abstraction. The client does not even know what factory it's going to use. First it gets a Factory and then it calls a Factory method. 
 *
 *
 * [Prototype]
 * Specify the kind of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype
 *
 * The prototype pattern is used to instantiate a new object by copying all of the properties of an existing object and thus creating an independent clone. This is particularly useful when the construction of a new object is inefficient or expensive.
 *
 *
 * [Singleton]
 * Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it
 *
 * The singleton pattern ensures that only one object of a particular class is ever created. All further references to objects of the singleton class refer to the same underlying instance.
 *
 * There are some who are critical of the singleton pattern and consider it to be an anti-pattern:
 *
 * It is frequently used in scenarios where it is not beneficial
 * It can introduce unnecessary restrictions in situations where a sole instance of a class is not actually required.
 * It introduces global state into an application.
 *
 * Structural Patterns
 *
 * These design patterns are all about class and object composition and provide a manner to define relationships between classes or objects. Structural class-creation patterns use inheritance to compose interfaces, while structural object-patterns define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality. 
 *
 *
 * [Adapter]
 * Convert the interface of a class into another interface clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces
 *
 * The adapter pattern is used to provide a link between two otherwise incompatible types by wrapping the "adaptee" with a class that supports the interface required by the client. This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to join functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces.
 *
 * A real life example could be a case of card reader which acts as an adapter between memory card and a laptop. You plugin the memory card into the card reader and the card reader into the laptop so that memory card can be read via the laptop.
 *
 *
 * [Bridge]
 * Decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently
 *
 * When an abstraction can have one of several possible implementations, the usual way to accommodate them is to use inheritance. An abstract class defines the interface to the abstraction, and concrete subclasses implement it in different ways. However, this approach isn't always flexible enough. Inheritance binds an implementation to the abstraction permanently, which makes it difficult to modify, extend, or reuse abstractions and implementations independently.
 *
 * The bridge pattern involves an interface that acts as a bridge, which makes the functionality of concrete classes independent from interface implementer-classes. Both types of classes can be altered structurally without affecting each other.
 *
 *
 * [Composite]
 * Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly
 *
 * The composite pattern describes a group of objects that is treated the same way as a single instance of the same type of object. The intent of a composite is to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Implementing the composite pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
 *
 * Composite should be used when clients ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects. If programmers find that they are using multiple objects in the same way, and often have nearly identical code to handle each of them, then composite is a good choice.
 *
 *
 * [Decorator]
 * Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically. Decorators provide a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality
 *
 * The decorator pattern is used to extend or alter the functionality of objects at run-time. This is done by wrapping them in an object of a decorator class without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class. This provides a flexible alternative to using inheritance to modify behavior.
 *
 * This pattern is often useful for following the practices of the Single Responsibility Principle, as it allows functionality to be divided between classes with unique areas of concern.
 *
 * An example of an application implementing a decorator pattern would be a graphical user interface toolkit. This toolkit should let you add properties like borders or behaviors like scrolling to any user interface component.
 *
 *
 * [Facade]
 * Provide a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. Façade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use
 *
 * The Facade design pattern is often used when a system is very complex or difficult to understand because the system has a large number of interdependent classes or its source code is unavailable. This pattern hides the complexities of the larger system and provides a simpler interface to the client.
 *
 * This pattern typically involves a single wrapper class that contains a set of members required by client. These members access the system on behalf of the facade client and hide the implementation details.
 *
 *
 * [Flyweight]
 * Use sharing to support large numbers of fine-grained objects efficiently
 *
 * The flyweight pattern is used to reduce the memory and resource usage for complex models containing many hundreds, thousands or hundreds of thousands of similar objects. It is a way to use objects in large numbers when a simple repeated representation would use an unacceptable amount of memory. Often some parts of the object state can be shared, and it is common practice to hold them in external data structures and pass them to the objects temporarily when they are used.
 *
 * A classic example usage of the flyweight pattern is the data structures for graphical representation of characters in a word processor. It might be desirable to have, for each character in a document, a glyph object containing its font outline, font metrics, and other formatting data, but this would amount to hundreds or thousands of bytes for each character. Instead, for every character there might be a reference to a flyweight glyph object shared by every instance of the same character in the document. Only the position of each character in the document would need to be stored internally.
 *
 *
 * [Proxy]
 * Provide a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it
 *
 * The proxy pattern is used to provide a surrogate or placeholder object, which references an underlying object. The proxy provides the same public interface as the underlying subject class, adding a level of indirection by accepting requests from a client object and passing these to the real subject object as necessary.
 *
 * A proxy, in its most general form, is a class functioning as an interface to something else. The proxy could interface to anything: a network connection, a large object in memory, a file, or some other resource that is expensive or impossible to duplicate. In short, a proxy is an agent object or wrapper that is being called by the client to access the real serving object behind the scenes.
 *
 * Use of the proxy can simply be forwarding to the real object, or can provide additional logic. In the proxy, extra functionality can be provided, for example caching when operations on the real object are resource intensive, or checking preconditions before operations on the real object are invoked. For the client, usage of a proxy object is similar to using the real object, because both implement the same interface.
 *
 *
 * Behavioral patterns
 *
 * Behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out this communication. 
 *
 *
 * [Chain of Responsibility]
 * Avoid coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object a chance to handle the request. Chain the receiving objects and pass the request along the chain until an object handles it
 *
 * In other words, the chain of responsibility pattern is used to process varied requests, each of which may be dealt with by a different handler.
 *
 * The pattern consists of a source of command objects and a series of processing objects. Each processing object contains logic that defines the types of command objects that it can handle, while the rest are passed to the next processing object in the chain. A mechanism also exists for adding new processing objects to the end of this chain.
 *
 * In a variation of the standard chain-of-responsibility model, some handlers may act as dispatchers, capable of sending commands out in a variety of directions, forming a tree of responsibility. In some cases, this can occur recursively, with processing objects calling higher-up processing objects with commands that attempt to solve some smaller part of the problem. In this case recursion continues until the command is processed, or the entire tree has been explored. An XML interpreter might work in this manner.
 *
 *
 * [Command]
 * Encapsulate a request as an object, thereby letting you parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations
 *
 * The command pattern is used to express a request, including the call to be made and all of its required parameters, in a command object. The command may then be executed immediately or held for later use.
 *
 * Four terms always associated with the command pattern are command, receiver, invoker and client:
 *
 * A command object knows about the receiver and invokes a method of the receiver. Values for parameters of the receiver method are stored in the command, the receiver object that will execute these methods is also stored in the command object by aggregation.
 * The receiver then does the work when the execute-method of the command is called. An invoker object knows how to execute a command, and optionally does bookkeeping about the command execution.
 * The invoker does not know anything about a concrete command, it knows only about command interface. Invoker object(s), command objects and receiver objects are held by a client object.
 * The client decides which receiver objects it assigns to the command objects, and which commands it assigns to the invoker. The client also decides which commands to execute at which points. To execute a command, it passes the command object to the invoker object.
 * Using command objects makes it easier to construct general components that need to delegate, sequence or execute method calls at a time of their choosing, without the need to know the class of the method or the method parameters. Using an invoker object allows bookkeeping about command executions to be conveniently performed, as well as implementing different modes for commands, which are managed by the invoker object, without the need for the client to be aware of the existence of bookkeeping or modes.
 *
 *
 * [Interpreter]
 * Given a language, define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language
 *
 * The interpreter pattern is a design pattern that specifies how to evaluate sentences in a language.
 *
 * The basic idea is to have a class for each symbol in a specialized language. The syntax tree of a sentence in the language is an instance of the composite pattern and is used to interpret the sentence for a client.
 *
 * An example of an interpreter would be the Reverse Polish Notation. This is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands. In this notation 1 + ((2 + 3) × 4) − 5 can be written as 1 2 3 + 4 × + 5 −
 *
 *
 * [Iterator]
 * Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation
 *
 * The iterator pattern is a design pattern in which an iterator is used to traverse a container and access the container's elements. The iterator pattern decouples algorithms from containers. In some cases, algorithms are necessarily container-specific and thus cannot be decoupled.
 *
 * In C#, a typical implementation of an iterator pattern would be the implementations of the IEnumerator/IEnumerator<T> interfaces that provides a means to iterate over some items.
 *
 *
 * [Mediator]
 * Define an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently
 *
 * Programs can be made up of a large number of classes among which logic and computation is distributed. However, as more classes are added to a program, the problem of communication between these classes may become more complex. This makes the program harder to read and maintain. Additionally, it can become difficult to change the program, since any change may affect code in several other classes.
 *
 * With the mediator pattern, communication between objects is encapsulated within a mediator object. Objects no longer communicate directly with each other, but instead communicate through the mediator. This reduces the dependencies between communicating objects, thereby reducing coupling.
 *
 *
 * [Memento]
 * Without violating encapsulation, capture and externalize an object's internal state so that the object can be restored to this state later
 *
 * The memento pattern is used to capture the current state of an object and store it in such a manner that it can be restored at a later time without breaking the rules of encapsulation (undo via rollback).
 *
 * The memento pattern is implemented with three objects: the originator, a caretaker and a memento:
 *
 * The originator is some object that has an internal state.
 * The caretaker is going to do something to the originator, but wants to be able to undo the change.
 * The caretaker first asks the originator for a memento object. Then it does whatever operation (or sequence of operations) it was going to do. To roll back to the state before the operations, it returns the memento object to the originator. The memento object itself is an opaque object (one which the caretaker cannot, or should not, change).
 *
 * Typical examples of memento patterns are saving and restoring the state of a player in a computer game or the implementation of an undo operation.
 *
 *
 * [Observer]
 * Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically
 *
 * The observer pattern is used to allow an object to publish changes to its state. Other objects subscribe to be immediately notified of any changes. In this pattern an object, called the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.
 *
 * It is mainly used to implement distributed event handling systems, in "event driven" software, which is built in in most modern languages for easy programming and short code.
 *
 * Examples in which the observer pattern are a key part, are the Model–View–Controller (MVC) architectural pattern and the ObservableCollection<T> class in .NET.
 *
 *
 * [State]
 * Allow an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. The object will appear to change its class
 *
 * The state pattern is used to alter the behavior of an object as its internal state changes. The pattern allows the class for an object to apparently change at run-time.
 *
 * The state design pattern implements a state machine by implementing each individual state as a derived class of the state pattern interface. State transitions are then implemented by invoking methods defined by the pattern's superclass.
 *
 * It can be interpreted as a strategy pattern that is able to switch the current strategy through invocations of methods defined in the pattern's interface.
 *
 * Using the state design pattern can be a cleaner way for an object to change its behavior at runtime without the need for large monolithic conditional statements and thus improve maintainability.
 *
 *
 * [Strategy]
 * Define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it
 *
 * The Strategy Design Pattern can be used when you want to perform a function, but you might use different techniques. It also lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
 *
 * For example, a class that performs validation on incoming data may use the Strategy pattern to select a validation algorithm depending on the type of data, the source of the data, user choice, or other discriminating factors. These factors are not known until run-time and may require radically different validation to be performed.
 *
 * The essential requirement to implement the Strategy pattern is the ability to store a reference to some code in a data structure and retrieve it. This can be achieved by mechanisms such as the native function pointer, the first-class function, classes or class instances in object-oriented programming languages, or accessing the language implementation's internal storage of code via reflection. One of the ways to do this in .NET, is to make use of the Action<T>-class.
 *
 *
 * [Template Method]
 * Define the skeleton of an algorithm in an operation, deferring some steps to subclasses. Template Method lets subclasses redefine certain steps of an algorithm without changing the algorithm's structure
 *
 * In the template method of this design pattern, one or more algorithm steps can be overridden by subclasses to allow differing behaviors while ensuring that the overarching algorithm is still followed.
 *
 * A concrete class is created that provides the steps of an algorithm design. Steps that are considered invariant (never changing) are implemented inside the base class. The steps that are considered to be variant, are given a default implementation or none at all. These variant steps must be supplied by the concrete derived subclasses. This way the general algorithm is saved in one place but the concrete steps may be changed by the subclasses.
 *
 * The template method pattern occurs naturally in C# where polymorphic or abstract methods are called. An example would be a generated class in which the base functionality is implemented and abstract methods are included and left for subclasses to implement.
 *
 *
 * [Visitor]
 * Represent an operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure. Visitor lets you define a new operation without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates
 *
 * The visitor design pattern is a way of separating an algorithm from an object structure on which it operates. A practical result of this is the ability to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying them. It is one way to follow the open / closed principle.
 *
 * Basically, the visitor allows adding new virtual functions to a family of classes, without modifying the classes. Instead, a visitor class is created that implements all of the appropriate specializations of the virtual function. The visitor takes the instance reference as input, and implements the goal through double dispatch.
 *
 * An real-world example of this pattern would be the operation of a taxi company. When a person calls a taxi company (accepting a visitor), the company dispatches a cab to the customer. Upon entering the taxi the customer, or Visitor, is no longer in control of his or her own transportation, the taxi is.
